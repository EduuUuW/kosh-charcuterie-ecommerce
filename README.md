<h2>📌 About the Project</h2>

<p>
This project is a modern and responsive website developed for <strong>Kosh Charcutaria</strong>, a brand focused on high-quality artisan meats and gourmet charcuterie products.
</p>

<p>
It was created as part of a <strong>university integrative project</strong>, developed by me and my team for a real client, aiming to deliver a functional and visually appealing digital presence for the company.
</p>

<p>
The website introduces the brand, showcases its products, and provides customers with a simple, intuitive ordering flow. The goal is to deliver a <strong>premium digital experience</strong> that reflects the elegance and authenticity of the charcutaria.
